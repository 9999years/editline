HowTo Build Minix Editline
==========================

Minix editline makes use of GNU configure tools, which includes autoconf, automake
and libtool. This enables high levels of portability and ease of use In most cases
all you need to do is unpack the tarball, enter the directory and type:

    ./configure

There are are, however, more options available.  For instance, sometimes it is useful
to build editline as a static library, type:

    ./configure --disable-shared

By default editline employs a default handler for the TAB key, pressing it once
completes to the nearest matching filename in the current working directory, or it
can display a listing of possible completions.  For some uses this default is not
desirable at all, type:

    ./configure --disable-default-complete

For more available options, type:

    ./configure --help

To build and install, simply type:

    make

and

    sudo make install

Good Luck!
