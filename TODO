Issues in need of work. Mostly compatibility with GNU readline, BSD libedit,
http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/, and usability improvements.

Remember, the general idea is to keep Minix editline small.

* Verify for 1.14.0 that custom completion handlers still work
After reverting "fix" in 0.2.2 that made rl_complete() a function pointer we need to
make sure the same functionality is still available with the new infrastructure.
(Which is more inspired by BSD libedit and GNU readline.

* Investigate GNU readline dependencies needed for "fileman" example
The BSD libedit library has imported the GNU readline "fileman" example into its
tree to demonstrate the abilities of that library.  This would also be quite useful
for Minix editline.

The first task is to investigate the depependencies and form TODO list items
detailing what is missing and, if possible, proposals how to implement including any
optional configure flags.

* Instead of supporting multiline input, try the Emacs approach, line scrolling.

* Add support for rl_bind_key(), currently only en editline specific el_bind_key() exists.

* Add support for inhibiting completion: rl_inhibit_completion

* Make "char *rl_prompt" globally visible.

* Add support for rl_set_prompt().

* Add support for --enable-utf8 to configure

* Use strcmp(nl_langinfo(CODESET), "UTF-8") to look for utf8 capable terminal.

* Implement simple UTF-8 parser according to http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html#utf-8
