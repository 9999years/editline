This is a line-editing library.  It can be linked into almost any
program to provide command-line editing and history.  

It is call-compatible with the FSF readline library, but it is a
fraction of the size (and offers fewer features).  It does not use
standard I/O.  It is distributed under a "C News-like" copyright, see
the file LICENSE for details.

Configuration is made by supplying different options to the GNU
configure script.  In the examples directory you can find a small and
slow shell for testing called testit.

This library was previously also packaged exclusively for Debian.  The
exact origin of the Debian version is unclear, see the Sid package at
http://packages.debian.org/sid/libeditline0 for details.  There are
some differences between that version and upstream, some of those
patches will also be merged here.

Enjoy,
