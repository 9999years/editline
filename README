======
This is a line-editing library.  It can be linked into almost any
program to provide command-line editing and recall.

It is call-compatible with the FSF readline library, but it is a
fraction of the size (and offers fewer features).  It does not use
standard I/O.  It is distributed under a "C News-like" copyright, see
the file LICENSE for details.

Configuration is made by supplying different options to the GNU
configure script.  In the examples directory, type "make testit" to
get a small slow shell for testing.

Changes
-------
An earlier version was distributed with Byron's rc.  Principal changes
over that version include:

 * Faster.
 * Is eight-bit clean (thanks to brendan@cs.widener.edu)
 * Written in K&R C, but ANSI compliant (gcc all warnings)
 * Propagates EOF properly; rc trip test now passes
 * Doesn't need or use or provide memmove.
 * More robust
 * Calling sequence changed to be compatible with readline.
 * Test program, new manpage, better configuration
 * More system-independant; includes Unix and OS-9 support.

This contains some changes since the posting to comp.sources.misc:
 * Bugfix for completion on absolute pathnames.
 * Better handling of M-n versus showing raw 8bit chars.
 * Better signal handling.
 * Now supports termios/termio/sgttyb ioctl's.
 * Add M-m command to toggle how 8bit data is displayed.

Bugs
----
There is one known bug. History-searching redraws the line wrong if
the text retrieved is shorter then the prompt.
